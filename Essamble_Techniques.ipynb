        "\n",
        "- Ensemble Learning in machine learning is a technique that combines multiple models (often called weak learners or base models) to create a more robust, accurate, and generalized model, known as an ensemble model.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Key Idea Behind Ensemble Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. A group of weak learners can come together to form a strong learner.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. In other words, rather than relying on a single model that might be biased or limited, ensemble methods aggregate the outputs of several models to reduce errors such as bias, variance, or overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "> How It Works\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Different models may make different types of errors. By combining their predictions:\n",
        "\n",
        "    a. Errors can cancel out, leading to better overall accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "    b. The final decision is often more stable and reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Types of Ensemble Learning Techniques\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Bagging - Train models independently in parallel on random subsets of data (with replacement). It reduces variance. Ex- Random Forest\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Boosting - Train models sequentially, each trying to correct the errors of the previous one. It reduces bias. Ex- AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Stacking - Combine multiple different models using a meta-model that learns how to best combine their outputs. Ex- Stacked Generalization\n",
        "\n",
        "> Benefits of Ensemble Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Better predictive performance than any individual model\n",

        "  2. Reduces overfitting\n",

        "\n",

        "  2. Model Training - Models are trained independently and in parallel\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Data Sampling - Uses bootstrapped datasets (random sampling with replacement)\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Model Weighting - All models usually have equal weight\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. Overfitting - Less prone to overfitting\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Ex- Random Forest (uses decision trees)\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Parallelism - Can be easily parallelized\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Think of asking multiple friends for advice independently and then taking a vote or average. The diversity in opinions smooths out extremes.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  3. Data Sampling - Each new model focuses more on misclassified data points (weighted sampling)\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Model Weighting - Models are weighted based on accuracy; better models get more influence\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. Overfitting - More prone to overfitting, but can be controlled\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Ex- AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- Bootstrap sampling is a technique where we randomly sample with replacement from the original dataset to create multiple new datasets (called bootstrap samples), each the same size as the original.\n",

        "> Role in Bagging (e.g., Random Forest) - In Bagging methods like Random Forest:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Each decision tree is trained on a different bootstrap sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Because sampling is with replacement, each tree sees a slightly different view of the data (some records may repeat, some may be left out).\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. This introduces diversity among the trees, which helps reduce variance and avoid overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Bootstrap sampling makes each model in the ensemble independent and diverse, which is essential for the averaging effect in Bagging to improve accuracy and stability.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Out-of-Bag (OOB) samples are the data points not included in a particular bootstrap sample when training a model in ensemble methods like Random Forest.\n",
        "\n",
        "> How OOB Samples Work:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. In bootstrap sampling (used in bagging), about 63% of the original data is sampled with replacement to train each model.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. The remaining ~37% that aren’t selected are the OOB samples for that model.\n",
        "\n",
        "> OOB Score for Evaluation:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Since each data point is likely to be left out from some trees, we can use those trees to predict the outcome for that data point.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. The OOB score is calculated by:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Predicting each sample using only the trees that did not see it during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Comparing the prediction to the actual label.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Aggregating the accuracy over all such OOB predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Why OOB Score is Useful:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. It acts like built-in cross-validation, providing a reliable estimate of model performance without needing a separate validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Saves time and data during model evaluation in Random Forests.\n",
        "\n",

        "  2. The more a feature helps split the data closer to the root, the higher its importance.\n",
