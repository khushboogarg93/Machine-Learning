        "\n",
        "  2. Label Encoding:\n",
        "  Assigns a unique integer to each category. Mostly used for ordinal categories but can introduce unintended order for nominal variables.\n",

        "\n",
        "> Role of Interaction Terms:\n",

        "\n",
        "  2. Multiple Linear Regression: The intercept represents the expected value of Y when all independent variables are zero simultaneously.\n",

        "  1. The slope determines how changes in X affect predicted values of Y\n",
        "\n",

        "### 17. How does the intercept in a regression model provide context for the relationship between variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The intercept in a regression model provides the baseline value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "> How it provides context:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. It sets the starting point or reference level of the outcome variable before considering the effects of predictors.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Helps to understand the overall positioning of the regression line or plane in the coordinate system.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. In some cases, the intercept has a meaningful real-world interpretation ex- initial value, while in others, it may be purely mathematical, especially if zero values of predictors are not realistic.\n",

        "\n",
        "- The limitations of using R² as the sole measure of model performance are:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Doesn't indicate causation: A high R^2 doesn't mean one variable causes changes in another.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Insensitive to overfitting: Adding more predictors always increases R^2, even if they don't improve the model meaningfully.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Doesn't measure prediction accuracy: A high R^2 on training data doesn't guarantee good predictions on new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Ignores bias and residual patterns: It doesn't reveal if the model violates assumptions or if errors are systematically biased.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. Not comparable across different datasets: R^2 values depend on the variance in the dependent variable, so it's hard to compare models with different datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Thus, R^2 should be used along with other metrics and diagnostic checks for a complete evaluation.\n",

        "> Identifying Heteroscedasticity in Residual Plots:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In a residual plot (residuals vs. predicted values or independent variable), heteroscedasticity appears as a pattern where the spread (variance) of residuals changes across the range of fitted values.\n",

        "    1. A funnel shape where residuals spread out or narrow as predicted values increase.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Residuals that fan out or cluster unevenly rather than being randomly scattered.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Why It's Important to Address Heteroscedasticity:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Violates the constant variance assumption of regression, undermining the reliability of standard errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Leads to biased or inefficient estimates of standard errors, affecting hypothesis tests and confidence intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Makes statistical inference invalid, which can cause incorrect conclusions about predictor significance.\n",

        "  1. The model likely includes irrelevant or unnecessary predictors that don’t improve explanatory power enough to justify their complexity.\n",

        "  1. Improves numerical stability: It prevents variables with large scales from dominating calculations and reduces computational issues.\n",

        "  3. Helps with regularization methods: Techniques like Ridge or Lasso regression require scaled variables to apply penalties effectively.\n",
